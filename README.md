The PDF document includes 3 diagrams that representing the process of the robot’s system and the functions of the physical parts in Rating Robot.

2- Sequence Diagram

The added idea in these diagrams to the robot that we want to let the robot makes a content on the social media. Particularly, we thought about adding a simple game to the robot’s system that the customer can play with it for about 30 seconds, such as, historical questions, food related questions, etc.. . During playing, the robot records the customers’ reaction using a camera. both the recording and the robot interactions could be uploaded to a social media platform (TikTok, Instagram, …). 


We believe that it may be a good way to attract customers to evaluate the restaurant and get more feedbacks, and some prizes could be given for the customers based on the results of the game!
